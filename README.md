# Advanced Backend Engineering Projects

**Note to Employers & Recruiters**

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of my ALX Africa advanced backend specialization. Each directory (0x00- through 0x03-) is a self-contained project built to demonstrate mastery of a specific, complex backend engineering concept.

These projects showcase my ability to write high-performance, scalable, and maintainable server-side code.

**üöÄ Project Showcase**

This portfolio highlights my hands-on experience with the following core backend challenges:

**Project Directory** &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; **Concept / Skill Demonstrated** &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; **Key Technologies**

0x00-pagination&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Advanced API Pagination&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Python, Flask / Django, REST API Design

<br />

This project demonstrates various pagination techniques (e.g., page-based, cursor-based) for efficiently serving large datasets from an API. It focuses on performance and creating clean, easy-to-use API responses.

<br />

0x01-caching&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Performance Caching&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Python, Redis, Memcached, Caching Algorithms

<br />

Implements in-memory caching to dramatically speed up application response times. This project explores different caching strategies (like FIFO, LIFO, LRU) and integration with tools like Redis to reduce database load.

<br />

0x02-i18n&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Internationalization (i18n)&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Python, Flask-Babel, Jinja2, Localization

<br />

Focuses on adapting a web application to support multiple languages and regions. This includes translating text, formatting dates and currencies, and managing user-specific locales, making an application globally accessible.


<br />

0x03-queuing_system_in_js&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Background Job & Message Queuing&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Node.js, JavaScript, Redis, Kue / RabbitMQ


<br />
This project builds a system for handling asynchronous background tasks. It includes creating job queues, writing worker processes to consume jobs, and managing job lifecycles (success, failure, retry), which is essential for scalable applications.
<br />


**üõ†Ô∏è Key Skills Demonstrated**

The projects in this repository collectively showcase my proficiency in:

API Design & Optimization: Building and paginating RESTful APIs for large-scale data.

Performance & Scaling: Using caching (Redis) and message queues to build fast, responsive, and resilient systems.

Asynchronous Processing: Writing workers to handle background tasks (like sending emails or processing data) without blocking the main application.

Software Globalization: Implementing i18n and localization to prepare applications for a global audience.

DevOps & Tooling: Working with Redis, message brokers (Kue, RabbitMQ), and modern Python/JavaScript environments.

**üì¶ How to Explore**

Each directory is a standalone project. To run any of them:

Clone this repository.

Navigate into a specific project folder (e.g., cd 0x00-pagination).

Each project has its own set of dependencies. Please refer to the requirements.txt (for Python) or package.json (for JavaScript) within each folder.

(Developer Note: I highly recommend adding a simple README.md inside each project folder with specific 1-2-3 steps on how to install and run that project. This shows professionalism!)
